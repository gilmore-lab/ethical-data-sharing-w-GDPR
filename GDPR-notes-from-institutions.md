## Questions and Concerns from EU Institutions regarding GDPR

### University of Manchester

I do not, obviously, know anything about the research project involved or about the nature and extent of the data being collected, but these measures would usually be along the lines of:
- Has the project received appropriate ethical approval?  
- Has the researcher undertaken appropriate Data protection training?  
- Has the researcher completed a Data Management Plan?  
- Are the data subjects aware of this use of their data and their rights under European law? (There may be ways around this one, but we would need to know details of the project before we could advise)
- Will we be a data controller or data processor for this data?  
- Is there any special category data involved?  

In summary, I don’t think that there is any bar to us signing this agreement in a data protection context, but we would need to be sure that the appropriate internal work had been done before we could receive and start using the data.

### University of Leeds

Under GDPR we cannot agree to accept the HIPAA code of conduct in relation to the work we are proposing to make available unless Databrary (possibly under HIPAA obligations) is compliant with the ‘Privacy Shield’ level of operation – if so then we may be able to transfer the recording’s subject to any further use of those recordings being compliant with the Privacy Shield Framework. This would mean that any organisation/body wishing to access the recording’s from thereon would also have to agree that they operate and are wholly compliant with the Privacy Shield Framework. See: https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome

If any body was not compliant then we would need to ask them to sign the attached GDPR standard terms, unequivocally.

Is it possible to accommodate this at all? We were hoping that a way around this could be by adding a disclaimer on the Databrary site that access to such recordings could only be granted after accession to the attached GDPR document, or solid confirmation that that body was compliant with the Privacy Shield Framework.



### University of Edinburgh

Our legal team at the University of Edinburgh has expressed serious concerns about the transfer of our data to Databrary, due largely to the nature of the data we intend to submit (videos of participants in an experiment, who are anonymous but potentially recognisable) and also, if I understand it correctly, to the fact that, outside Privacy Shield, the US is not recognised as a country providing fully adequate data protection by GDPR standards.

1. We do not, as a policy sign up to contracts with a hold harmless provision.  

I would require the term “and renders harmless” to be removed from the contract

2. We usually require a two way indemnity and in any event that indemnity is usually capped (below is the language we use)

  - X1. The aggregate liability of each Party in connection with this Agreement or the subject matter hereof (whether arising in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise) shall be limited to ten thousand pounds sterling (£10,000).  

  - X2. Subject to clause X3 neither Party shall be liable to the other Party for any indirect, consequential or special damages or losses, or any loss of profits, loss of revenue (other than revenue due under this Agreement or any other agreement entered into between the Parties) which   arises directly or indirectly from that Party’s breach or non-performance of this Agreement, or negligence in the performance of this Agreement or from any liability arising in any other way out of the subject matter of this Agreement even if the Party bringing the claim has advised the other Party of the possibility of those losses arising, or if such losses were within the contemplation of the Parties.  

  - X3. Nothing in this Agreement limits or excludes either Party’s liability for:  
      - X3.1 death or personal injury caused by negligence; or
      - X3.2 fraud or for any other type of liability that, by law, cannot be limited or excluded.  
      - X3.3 Breach of relevant data protection legislation  

3. Photographs are definitely personal data, so we would need reassurance that the data we are receiving the data is GDPR-compliant. ( general Data Protection Regulation) , There doesn’t appear to be any confirmations in here about the legal basis or authority for sharing the images. Do you  provide any information or have a policy about GDPR compliance when providing images to users in Europe?

### University of Giessen  

In Europe, we now have a new data protection regime which makes such agreements a little bit more complicated. For example, in our data protection agreements we have to make sure that data will be deleted, for example in 10 or 15 years. As far as I understood databarary, the data won't be deleted. This could be a problem. So, we will further work on the issues and then let you know.
